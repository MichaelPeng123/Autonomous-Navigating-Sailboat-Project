# Autonomous Navigating Sailboat

An algorithm that autonomously navigates the rudders of a sail-boat using a PID (Proportional, Derivative, and Integral) controller computed from parsed compass and GPS Data. This technical algorithm is a part of my engineering research project at the Boston Leadership Institute.
